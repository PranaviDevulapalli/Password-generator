# Secure Password Generation (Python)

This Python program generates cryptographically strong random passwords to ensure high security. It utilizes the `random` library to create passwords that are difficult to guess.

## Features

- **Customizable Passwords**: Users can adjust the length of the password and include different character types such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to create personalized passwords.
- **High Security**: The passwords generated are cryptographically strong, ensuring robust security against brute-force attacks.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The program provides a simple and intuitive interface for generating passwords, making it accessible for users of all skill levels.


## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `secure_password_generation.py` file using a Python interpreter.
3. Follow the prompts to specify the desired password length and character types.
4. The program will generate a secure password based on your preferences and display it on the screen.

## Example

```bash
$ python secure_password_generation.py
Enter password length: 12
Include uppercase letters? (y/n): y
Include lowercase letters? (y/n): y
Include numbers? (y/n): y
Include symbols? (y/n): y
```

Generated Password: Lb&3Gw#5qS@9

## Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas for enhancing this project further in the future:

- GUI Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt to provide a more interactive user experience.
- Password Strength Meter: Implement a feature to evaluate the strength of the generated password and provide feedback to the user.
- Password History: Add functionality to store previously generated passwords securely and allow users to retrieve them when needed.
- Password Policy Compliance: Ensure that generated passwords comply with common password policies such as minimum length, character types, and avoiding dictionary words.
- Integration with Password Managers: Integrate the program with popular password managers to seamlessly generate and store passwords.
